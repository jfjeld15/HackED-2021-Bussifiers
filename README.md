# HackED-2021-Bussifiers

Shared repo for HackEd Beta 2021 design - Ski Trip Planner

## Summary

Shared positions of top 10 winter resorts around Western Canada, specifically, around the Rocky Mountain Ranges.

## About

The map displays 10 resorts with interactive button to access homepages of resorts for detailed information. The sidebar indicates the average annual snowfall of all ten resorts from 2011 to 2019. An elevation indicator to compare different peak height of resorts is currently a work in progress.  

## Usage Directions

To run the program, run 'python3 windowbase.py' from the current directory in the terminal.
- THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY IF THE USER IS NOT IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE FILE: windowbase.py

A user can see how the image 'grad_plt_trans.png' was created by running 'python3 grad_numpy.py' from the terminal.
- note that the generated gradient does not have a transparent background, as we removed it with a third party program (GIMP)
